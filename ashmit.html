        members, with some even claiming that the videos have saved their lives. ... The ultimate goal is for men to
        achieve their dream life, which includes being in amazing shape, having financial success, and enjoying
        fulfilling relationships with women.</p>

    <h3>How he helps</h3>
    <p>His general audience is young naïve kids and so to a lot of them his advice might seem great when to most older
        people it probably does not.<br>These young people might think “people struggle to do the obvious stuff so he
        gives pretty detailed in depth advice for most things”, if someone is struggling to actually apply the theory
        they know then more theoretical advice isn’t necessarily going to make them take action</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Is Hamza good</h4>
    <pr>The people who dislike this type of content are threatened that they're getting called out for their bad
        habits.<em>It's hard to face the reality that the pointless self pleasure of jerking off and watching netflix
            all day is bad.</em></pr>
